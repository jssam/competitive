Chef's birthday is coming soon, so Miu decided to gift him a set of 3 strings.
The 3 strings are A, B & C all of length N and all consisting of lowercase English alphabets.

Chef likes the set of strings if all the strings can be made equal after performing the following operation some amount of times:

Select any two adjacent characters in A and swap them. Then select any two adjacent characters in B and swap them. Then select any two adjacent characters in C and swap them.
Note that in one move he swaps exactly one pair of adjacent characters in A, exactly one pair of adjacent characters in B and exactly one pair of adjacent characters in C.

Help Miu determine if the set of strings she selected will be liked by Chef or not.

Input:
The first line of the input consists of a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
First line of each test case consists of a single integer N denoting the length of the strings.
The next 3 lines consist of the strings A, B & C respectively.
Output:
For each test case if the set of strings is liked by Chef print "YES" without the quotes else print "NO" without the quotes in a single line.
Constraints
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 105

Sample Input:

Sample Output:
YES
NO

EXPLANATION:
Example Case 1:
Here in one move he can select the following characters and swap them:
From A: 1st and 2nd
From B: 3rd and 4th
From C: 5th and 6th
Now, all the strings become equal i.e., “abcdef” thus Chef will like the set of strings.
Note that Chef can make as many moves as much he wants.

Example Case 2:
Here, he can perform any number of swaps but the 3 strings can never be equal.
